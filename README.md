### Assignment Log

#### **Step 217-218: SQL Server Express and SSMS Installation**

- **Date**: November 1, 2025
- **Objective**: Successfully install and configure the necessary local database
  environment, including the **SQL Server Express** database engine (64-bit) and
  the **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** client tool (version 21 or later).
- **Outcome**: The database environment was successfully set up. Connection to
  the local instance was verified after resolving the initial "network path not
  found" error by using the Server Name shorthand `.\SQLEXPRESS` and enabling
  the "Trust server certificate" option. This foundational setup allows for
  direct execution of SQL queries and database management for subsequent
  lessons.
